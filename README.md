## Hi, I'm Andrew Sweet ðŸ‘‹

I am a passionate product-focused software engineer that loves to solve hard technical
problems while focusing on delivering polished, delightful user experiences.

Having studied Computer Science and Art at Carnegie Mellon University, I thrive in
collaborative interdisciplinary settings -- I love wearing many hats, collaborating
with Product and Design, rapid prototyping, engaging with users, a ultimately
shipping measurable value. I've worked at companies like dbt Labs, Google,
Nike, Iontank, and more.
